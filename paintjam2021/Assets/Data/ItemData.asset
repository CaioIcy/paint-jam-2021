  Items:
  - ID: item_Alexa_alpha
    Name: Alexa
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 36d5c731881121244839214c39e2ad42, type: 3}
    Use: Primitive humans used this as a weight to lift and strenghten their arms
      for hunting with spears.
    Discovery: Found in the wreckage of a modern human home.  This is definitive
      proof that throughout time, humans  have always valued the ability of hunting
      with spears.
    Observations: Comes with an appendage. Likely used to hang around human wrists
      and prevent the weight from falling and causing accidents.
  - ID: item_Arcade Stick_alpha
    Name: Arcade Stick
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: b4b66e6fb108a494085089369e63c34f, type: 3}
    Use: 'A controller used for handling spacecraft. '
    Discovery: Found under a large venue with chairs and monitors, likely a space
      station. A ghastly stench of human sweat permeated the air around the location.
    Observations: Humans went to greath lengths in order to launch hunks of metal
      into space for reasons unclear. Experts speculate they did so to show off their
      status and wealth.
  - ID: item_Banana Peel_alpha
    Name: Banana Peel
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: ca9aeb51c98915a499911871e1c20a29, type: 3}
    Use: A soft hat to protect humans from the rain.
    Discovery: Found in a trash can. Apparently, this model did not work properly
      and was tossed, though it is suspected that it was merely due to the incompetency
      of its human user.
    Observations: An early humanologist theorized that these were home defense traps
      designed to make other humans slip and fall, potentially cracking their skulls,
      but this theory was quickly disproven.
  - ID: item_Battery_alpha
    Name: Battery
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: aa5a17ef94b359d40a0976198c466a5a, type: 3}
    Use: These small items were used as a substitute for mothers who neglected nurturing
      their babies. They provided important nutrients as they were nibbled on.
    Discovery: Found inside a large lot full of radiated air and acid. This was obviously
      a nursery home.
    Observations: This is one of the few human items which can still benefit our
      species. Our infants love to nibble on these things, and grow strong!
  - ID: item_Best Poster_alpha
    Name: Best Poster
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 12e81944818da89458406a7a3f786a8a, type: 3}
    Use: An ad for a play, which featured a colorful cast of  characters, including
      different species which co-existed with humans, like ogres, donkeys and dragons.
    Discovery: This poster was found amidst other ads for plays by a human named
      "Britney Speare", presumably an expert in human-on-ogre romance fantasy.
    Observations: It is unclear how humans managed to cast these different species
      in the play, considering they were much more powerful and ruled over their
      puny race. It was likely an act of mercy.
  - ID: item_Bike Seat_alpha
    Name: Bike Seat
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e6b43da8ab898654fb52067c6f1c3395, type: 3}
    Use: An object humans would chew in order to strenghten their jaw and teeth.
    Discovery: Found attached to a strange object with wheels. No one in the whole
      world has any idea what that object could possibly be.
    Observations: This particular one has many bite marks, with the imprints of teeth
      much larger than humans usually had. This illustrates how effective this jaw-training
      object was at its job.
  - ID: item_Blender_alpha
    Name: Blender
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: d88896b1bc07fed4693346f162d86359, type: 3}
    Use: A hard hat to protect humans against hazardous objects which might fall
      from above onto their heads.
    Discovery: Found in the rubble of a destroyed house, next to a human fossil.
      It seems this hat was not strong enough to defend the human's head from their
      collapsing house.
    Observations: Humans tried hard to protect themselves from physical damage, but
      failed to recognize that microscopical creatures were far more dangerous to
      their fragile immune systems. Truly an astounding species.
  - ID: item_Brut Vodka_alpha
    Name: Brut Vodka
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 55e215a10d799e1499feb15280913abe, type: 3}
    Use: Cleaning product, varied uses, from cleaning the house to anti-bacterial
      cleaning for cuts and bruises.
    Discovery: Found inside an old ragged coat lost in a blizzard, with no traces
      of the owner left behind.
    Observations: Most bottles found are usually empty, showing humans still had
      a sense of obligation to clean the earth before going extinct.
  - ID: item_Canned Pickles_alpha
    Name: Canned Pickles
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 7ba831c61e1e2e44cae3826ad06a387a, type: 3}
    Use: 'A can which at one point contained "Pickles", a staple food in the human
      diet. '
    Discovery: Discovered inside a totaled truck containing multiple copies of itself,
      likely to be distributed to art swindlers  worldwide.
    Observations: This is a cheap knockoff of Dankbells Soup. After the perfect consumable
      item was invented, humans rushed to try and imitate it, failing miserably.
      A simpleton would not be able to notice the difference between both art pieces,
      however.
  - ID: item_Clay Filter_alpha
    Name: Clay Filter
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: bdfe734cd3d416f429bc52591ea66ffd, type: 3}
    Use: A futuristic, cylindric house model.
    Discovery: 'Discovered alongside other cylindrical glass objects. These were
      likely placeholder house models. '
    Observations: This model's architect was so ahead of their time, that humans
      shunned them and stuck to building inferiorly-shaped rectangular houses until
      the end of their times.
  - ID: item_Fake Flakes_alpha
    Name: Fake Flakes
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 6f32d13a720fc4146ac374121012575b, type: 3}
    Use: This is food devised to please the palate of fishes.  In order to maintain
      peaceful relations with their  superior species, humans would appease their
      bellies.
    Discovery: Found inside a cupboard. In case fishes would threaten human life,
      this was an important emergency item used to de-escalate conflict.
    Observations: Fishes are known to control the oceans, and could easily wipe out
      humans by summoning a group attack known as "Tsunami" if they so pleased. Humans
      feared a fishy apocalypse, but ultimately ended themselves first.
  - ID: item_Flip Flop_alpha
    Name: Flip Flop
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 97021d9c4313e184eb5e1843ebff6076, type: 3}
    Use: A glove used for protecting human hands from touching scorching surfaces.
    Discovery: Found by the door of a human home. Humans would use these gloves to
      check if the doorknob was hot before using it, in order to avoid burning their
      frail hands.
    Observations: The design of these gloves is such that they may also be worn on
      human feet, if they prefer to interact with objects using their lower appendages.
  - ID: item_GameToy_alpha
    Name: GameToy
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 13dd83a6b3ab990468222164e73497ec, type: 3}
    Use: An interface used for summoning and interacting with demons.
    Discovery: Encountered under the pillow of a human infant's bed. Demonically
      possessed children were a common occurrence within the species.
    Observations: Game Toys could be combined with different catridges, each holding
      their own demonic spirit, ready to be released in the comfort of one's own
      home.
  - ID: item_Guitar_alpha
    Name: Guitar
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 97be09025d75df94f9e2b2948944ea68, type: 3}
    Use: A weapon that made an extremely loud sound when bashed against another human's
      head, paralyzing them.
    Discovery: Found in an armory. Humans manufactured many different such weapons
      with different decals and designs, illustrating their unhealthy obsession with
      weaponry.
    Observations: A team of talented humanologists have discovered that, by strumming
      the strings of the guitars, they could produced a sound that was actually rather
      pleasant. If only humans had figured this one out.
  - ID: item_Hair Dryer_alpha
    Name: Hair Dryer
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 1b48b11854b027f4b90e866c9b3a330d, type: 3}
    Use: This device was utilized to heat up food, as humans preferred to eat their
      food warm.
    Discovery: 'Discovered inside a human bathroom. This makes us believe that humans
      would regularly eat their meals while evacuating. Disgusting. '
    Observations: Humans would regularly host religious rituals called "Barbecues",
      and smoke ceremonial meats using this device.
  - ID: item_Imps Keychain_alpha
    Name: Imps Keychain
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 9b67504be6501514d8039e02c03284bf, type: 3}
    Use: A custom earplug to help humans to sleep comfortably.
    Discovery: Found attached to house keys. When human cars sounded their very loud
      alarms, these earplugs would help reduce the ear damage caused by the noise.
    Observations: Humans with two ears would necessitate two of these items in order
      to fully protect themselves.
  - ID: item_Iron_alpha
    Name: Iron
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: df170ccbe32bc0e4a908789d65faaa2a, type: 3}
    Use: 'A highly advanced spaceship wingless insects used to get around.  '
    Discovery: Found on a landing runway in a human home. Insects would seemingly
      travel to and from human homes  without them even noticing.
    Observations: It is unknown how these machines operated, but they are most definitely
      a highly technological marvel of insect technology which we may never truly
      be able to fathom.
  - ID: item_Kugo Action Figure_alpha
    Name: Kugo Action Figure
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 6b2d73faf5cd68140ae8cce21cbb44d9, type: 3}
    Use: A figure of a war hero which humans worshipped.
    Discovery: This small statue was found among other representations of war heroes,
      especially young female ones. Humans highly valued their warmongering elite.
    Observations: The arms on this particular statue can move around and make a pose,
      clasping both hands. This power pose was used to rally platoons into the battlefield.
  - ID: item_Lesgo_alpha
    Name: Lesgo
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e94525f923ef4094ebb6413dea5ce2cd, type: 3}
    Use: A home security device which operated as a land  trap. Stepping on one of
      these would cause human trespassers unimaginable pain.
    Discovery: Found inside a box containing other similar traps of different shapes
      and sizes. Such dangerous boxes  were commonly sold as consumer goods.
    Observations: These traps could tether to themselves, forming whichever shape
      the trapper  desired. This was one of humans' most technological and effective
      inventions.
  - ID: item_Marge Rina_alpha
    Name: Marge Rina
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: a5a49b5d8b3563447bf67afcc443b83b, type: 3}
    Use: A picture of an uninteresting person drawn by a human infant.
    Discovery: Found in the wreckage of a large building riddled with other childish
      doodles. This was likely a daycare.
    Observations: Humans highly valued childish illustrations due to their abnormal
      attachment to their own offspring. Their babies were taken care of full-time
      by their parents until they reached maturity, at 30 years old.
  - ID: item_Matrioshka Dolls_alpha
    Name: Matrioshka Dolls
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: c1633efe54f688142803ff2ac9091198, type: 3}
    Use: A multi-layered protective case, used to hold things of great value to humans,
      most often their favourite pet, the egg.
    Discovery: Discovered in a nearly perfect state, being preserved inside a fridge.
      Sadly, no egg was found inside.
    Observations: 'Even with no lock system present, the idea behind its design is
      that the perpetrator would get bored and give up trying to open it before reaching
      its final layer - thus keeping their egg intact. '
  - ID: item_Mike Johnson_s Killer_alpha
    Name: Mike Johnson_s Killer
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 19ae0e15fa9944a43bc34a12365d16ac, type: 3}
    Use: A brutal disc-like throwing weapon used for decapitating other humans.
    Discovery: Found in an armory which had numerous other such death discs in display.
      Humans loved to mass-produce and distribute deadly weapons.
    Observations: If there was one thing humans loved more than destroying their
      planet, it was killing each other. If there was no reason to, they'd gladly
      invent one.
  - ID: item_MP3 Player_alpha
    Name: MP3 Player
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: c3fdeef146f34f340b3c387b1b412445, type: 3}
    Use: Humans inserted this toy into their mouths to gather  bodily warmth data,
      for entertainment purposes. It  was briefly popular as a fad, then faded out.
    Discovery: Found in a collapsed home. A strange sound was emanating from it at
      the time of its discovery, but no one has ever heard it since. Humanologists
      concluded that this item was merely temporarily possessed by a demonic entity.
    Observations: Humans would occasionaly insert this item into their ears by mistake,
      causing irreversible hearing loss.
  - ID: item_Nobel Prize_alpha
    Name: Nobel Prize
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: b440c99b2e0944642a005f711ab5f75f, type: 3}
    Use: A device meant to mind control living beings. Through engraving the victim's
      name on the plaque, humans could completely hypnotize others of their own species.
    Discovery: Salvaged from an area named "Ollywood", presumed to be a massive mind
      control research complex.
    Observations: Humans valued controlling others very highly, as they did not believe
      in peaceful resolutions or diplomatic reasoning.
  - ID: item_Pacifier_alpha
    Name: Pacifier
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2dff86be4c8a8ba4a84952d4405e463d, type: 3}
    Use: Human adults used this item to enhance sexual pleasure by introducing it
      in their orifices.
    Discovery: Found on a human infant's mouth. Truly, there was no limit to human
      degeneracy.
    Observations: The existence of this item confirms that humans were openly degenerates,
      much moreso than our species, which value integrity and public opinion.
  - ID: item_Paper Clip_alpha
    Name: Paper Clip
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2f4b5f2625c0251479085a97bdb88686, type: 3}
    Use: A discrete assassination weapon that could be attached to clothing and hidden
      from sight, then twisted into a tiny spear.
    Discovery: Discovered in the wreckage of a human office. This illustrates how
      cut-throat human jobs really were.
    Observations: Handle with care, as this item breaks very easily. Humans were
      not great at making quality products.
  - ID: item_Pen_alpha
    Name: Pen
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e00691cbb8888cd478d7158b1bef9bd0, type: 3}
    Use: This pointy item is a paintbrush, used to ink reminders humans' skin. These
      were called "Tattoos".
    Discovery: 'This was found inside a cup with similar brushes. "Tattoos" were
      popular in office spaces, as humans would use their own bodies as schedules
      or white boards. '
    Observations: Humans were notorious for their lack of long-term and short-term
      memory. They would constantly forget even the most important of dates, such
      as their international holiday of "Watermelon Seed Day".
  - ID: item_Ping Pong Paddle_alpha
    Name: Ping Pong Paddle
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: c7ea96ffd6152aa4dbf520699404052a, type: 3}
    Use: These round objects were used to protect the human eye from the Sun. Also
      comes with a convenient grip to make holding it easier.
    Discovery: While many fragmented paddles have been found, the few intact ones
      to be found were located near churches. This might indicate a possible religious
      importance.
    Observations: Early on, these paddles were thought to be early human wheel concepts.
      Further investigation has determined, however, that humans did not invent the
      wheel at all, but instead stole such technology from beings of other planets.
  - ID: item_Pliers_alpha
    Name: Pliers
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 43d250188bb9a014e8d8f5e25d9fd5d0, type: 3}
    Use: 'A bladed weapon devised for battling  smaller insects. '
    Discovery: Discovered in a case full of other nefarious objects, likely a torture
      kit to pry insects for information.
    Observations: Insects, as we know, are much smarter than humans, and thus were
      easily able to outmanuever these rudimentary weapons.
  - ID: item_Potato Chip_alpha
    Name: Potato Chip
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: f3087cf5c34b0f545a809d33fe7d7777, type: 3}
    Use: A piece of salty and wavy memorabilia. Likely used as decoration, to remind
      humans of the ocean.
    Discovery: Found inside a long can, likely a gift receptacle previously filled
      with packing peanuts.
    Observations: Breaks off very easily. Its fragility is likely intentional, as
      a representation of humans' short and pathetic lifespans.
  - ID: item_Queue-Tip_alpha
    Name: Queue-Tip
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: adc3134bc39486f47b72bebd337785ab, type: 3}
    Use: A culinary tool, used for gathering small food portions and carrying them
      into the humans' mouths.
    Discovery: Found in a pack alongside many other identical tools. This is likely
      due to them becoming obsolete very easily, as a result of a phenomenon called
      "Planned Obsolescence".
    Observations: Humans were hopelessly outmatched by other species which lived
      alongside them,  like the ones they called "Anteaters". This was how they tried,
      and failed, to compensate.
  - ID: item_Recorder_alpha
    Name: Recorder
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 6a47baa772770594f984d019662261df, type: 3}
    Use: Recreational device used by humans to surpass the limitations of their bodies
      and smoke the largest amount of rolled herbs simultaneously possible.
    Discovery: Unearthed inside a building named "School", likely a place where humans
      congregated in order to do drugs.
    Observations: Out of the many human degeneracies, getting inebriated with herbs
      was one of the most foul routinely practiced by the species. In a shocking
      discovery, researchers found that even the newborn were obligated to participate
      in such rituals.
  - ID: item_Remote_alpha
    Name: Remote
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e87f246db90ba0f4ea8bc9990e5bd1c5, type: 3}
    Use: One of the humans' most technologically advanced items. This was used to
      open interdimensional portals and travel through space and time.
    Discovery: Found buried deep beneath a couch. Goes to show that no matter how
      important an item was, it would somehow always carelessly slip away from their
      gross, greasy little hands.
    Observations: This was modern humans' main mode of transportation. The engravings
      on its interface have been translated by our team, and represent primitive
      coordinates.
  - ID: item_Rubber Chicken_alpha
    Name: Rubber Chicken
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: bb17299dc730c61468051551e51d7e0b, type: 3}
    Use: A sculpture of an animal which humans worshipped religiously.
    Discovery: Found above a door. Humans believed this placement of the object would
      bring them good luck.
    Observations: This sculpture was believed to be able to communicate with its
      worshipper, if their faith was strong enough. This has obviously been debunked,
      as sculptures cannot emit sound.
  - ID: item_Saw_alpha
    Name: Saw
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 8399d5b4e89f8674893830245f64d43b, type: 3}
    Use: This item's use is one of the most highly debated questions in the field
      of humanology, but our best theory is that it was used to cut stuff. Most likely,
      other humans. Despicable.
    Discovery: This was found in a torture chamber with other tools for smacking
      and cutting. So many torture chambers  were discovered around the globe, we
      can only  assume humans had a sick fetish for pain.
    Observations: Our species has reapropriated these kinds of deadly items for everyday
      use. For example, we use this tool to cut wood and build homes - if only humans
      knew how to properly use the things they themselves created.
  - ID: item_Shoe_alpha
    Name: Shoe
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e3fe0b135cc0ca04ca5f81fe24794f51, type: 3}
    Use: A recipient for collecting human feces.
    Discovery: Fished from the sea. This is where humans were known to dump their
      droppings in, which explained their terrible race-relations with fish.
    Observations: This feces-shaped pouch was also used in house parties to prank
      other  humans who would accidentally step on them, and dirty their feet.
  - ID: item_Spatula_alpha
    Name: Spatula
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2158169ad9fd3cc41a812fe5addbe724, type: 3}
    Use: This was a disciplinary tool for reprimanding naughty human infants.
    Discovery: Found inside a rectangular container, alongside other disciplinary
      tools of similar use. The naughtier the infant acted, the deadlier the tool
      used.
    Observations: 'A spanking from this object would likely lacerate the infants''
      fragile skins, scarring them permanently. Humans were truly the worst. '
  - ID: item_Speaker_alpha
    Name: Speaker
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 93c04eef3a48bb641830693c6ba7f8d6, type: 3}
    Use: A tray table recipient with two bowls for human meals.
    Discovery: Discovered in an armory full of guitars. This, alongside the resilience
      of the object, strenghtens the theory that this was mainly used during battles
      to serve food for soldiers.
    Observations: The left bowl was typically reserved for a nutritious meal, and
      the right bowl was reserved for what humans called "Dessert", which actively
      helped in the decay of their teeth and heart. It was truly a foolish ritual.
  - ID: item_Super Killerman 2000 Deluxe 3_alpha
    Name: Super Killerman 2000 Deluxe 3
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: ed704b29376373342845e0e8ea6ebd66, type: 3}
    Use: A romance movie, able to be reproduced on a movie-playing console.
    Discovery: Unearthed amidst the rubble of a teenage human's room. Teenagers loved
      movies, and often pretended to control their outcome using plastic interfaces.
    Observations: Movies were moving pictures which represented a narrative, in which
      humans overcame adversity and inevitably triumphed in the end. This, of course,
      was pure fantasy and never actually happened in human history as we know it.
  - ID: item_Telescope_alpha
    Name: Telescope
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 323e662c12d9bec4fb0283a81df7ba70, type: 3}
    Use: This was an instrument used for playing a bloody sport humans called "Baseball".
    Discovery: Found inside a large, globe-shaped hut. This was the place in which
      "Baseball" games took place.
    Observations: In "Baseball", humans attempted to knock each other out using this
      instrument. The last player standing would yell "Home Run!" and be deemed victorious,
      attaining endless glory and wealth.
  - ID: item_Umbrella_alpha
    Name: Umbrella
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: ee691bf92a2030444b5982f9e494ef2b, type: 3}
    Use: An offensive and defensive weapon, mimicking the design of a lance and a
      shield at the same time when open.
    Discovery: These items have been found scattered all around the globe. Humans
      were a warmongering species that glorified combat,  participating in it for
      sport during their daily routines.
    Observations: Considered by many the peak of close-ranged human combat, most
      houses had at least one, if not many. The small sized variants indicate human
      infants were trained to master it from an early age.
  - ID: item_War Hat_alpha
    Name: War Hat
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 07ec35babaa49e9429e4777b2ed23cf7, type: 3}
    Use: A hat designed for players of the bloody sport "Baseball". The emblem on
      it varies according to the player's ranking.
    Discovery: Collected from a fallen war-loving human's collection.  "Baseball"
      seemed to be very popular among war fans.
    Observations: Despite its bloody and violent nature, baseball players preferred
      to look their best with this high-fashion hat when practising it, as opposed
      to wearing real head protection gear.
  - ID: item_Xabasco Pepper_alpha
    Name: Xabasco Pepper
    Sprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 1ff42f1e49c8f5949b8ee1dd4093801f, type: 3}
    Use: These eyedrops were used to lubricate human eyes, which were incredibly
      dry and sensitive.
    Discovery: Found in the remains of a human "Restaurant". We are unsure of the
      purpose of this establishment, but experts speculate it was a place of religious
      importance.
    Observations: Xabasco was needed in order to heal eye damage caused by staring
      into the sun. Humans believed this act would gift them with superpowers.
